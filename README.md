#  Tech Demo 🚀🌟

In this demo, you'll showcase your understanding of the 3/4 pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism for extra credit. You'll create a fun and interactive program and share with the class via a tech demo that demonstrates your many skills! 🎉🎓

## Getting Started 🏁

1. **Create a new Java project** in repl.it find the project named tech-demo-final, you can copy/paste your current project code here or use this time to start with a new idea!
2. 
3. **Choose a theme** for your tech demo. It can be anything you like, such as a zoo, a school, a video game, or even a magical world! You may also build off of the in-class coding examples, e.g., starwars game and the deck of cards 🦁🏫🎮🧙
4. **Design classes** that represent the different components of your theme, using the OOP concepts you've learned. 

## Demonstrating OOP Concepts 🔍

To make sure your tech demo showcases the 4 pillars of OOP, follow these guidelines:

### Encapsulation 🔒

Create classes with private fields and use public methods (getters) to access those fields. This demonstrates data hiding and ensures that the internal state of the object is protected.

### Inheritance 👨‍👧

Create a hierarchy of classes, where child classes inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes. This will show how you can reuse code and create more specialized classes using inheritance.

### Abstraction 🎭

Implement abstract classes or interfaces (think custom methods in a class like deck.deal() ) to define common behaviors for a group of related classes. This will demonstrate how abstraction can be used to create flexible and extensible code.

### Polymorphism 🔀

As extra credit

## Structuring Your Tech Demo 🏗

1. **Create a `README.md` file** in your project to explain the theme and the OOP concepts you've used.
2. **Write descriptive comments** in your code to help explain the purpose of each class, method, and field.
3. **Include sample input and output** in your `README.md` file to show how your program works.
4. **Add fun emojis** 😄 to your `README.md` file and comments to make them more engaging and enjoyable to read!


Remember to have fun, be creative, and show off your OOP skills! Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀🌟

# OOP Tech Demo Presentation Rubric 📋🌟

Use this rubric to evaluate your peer's project based on their tech demo. Each category is scored on a scale of 1 (needs improvement) to 5 (excellent).

## 1. OOP Concepts Demonstrated (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism) 🏆

- 1: No OOP concepts demonstrated or not clear
- 3: Some OOP concepts demonstrated, but not all or not clearly
- 5: All OOP concepts demonstrated and clearly explained

## 2. Theme and Creativity 🎨

- 1: Theme is unclear or not well developed
- 3: Theme is evident, but lacks creativity or originality
- 5: Theme is clear, creative, and engaging

## 3. Code Quality and Structure 💻

- 1: Code is disorganized, difficult to read, or lacks comments
- 3: Code is somewhat organized, but could use improvement in readability or comments
- 5: Code is well organized, easy to read, and well commented

## 4. README.md and Documentation 📚

- 1: README.md is missing or lacks information about the project
- 3: README.md is present but could use more detail or better formatting
- 5: README.md is well written, informative, and includes sample input and output

## 5. Presentation Skills 🗣

- 1: Student struggles to present or explain their project
- 3: Student presents their project, but could use more clarity or confidence
- 5: Student presents their project clearly, confidently, and engages the audience

## 6. Use of Emojis and Fun Elements 😄

- 1: No use of emojis or fun elements in the project
- 3: Some use of emojis or fun elements, but could be more engaging
- 5: Excellent use of emojis and fun elements throughout the project

Remember to provide constructive feedback and encourage your peers to continue improving their skills! 🌟
